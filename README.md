# Dakar2026-StageViz

A cheeky Dakar 2026 Stage Visualizer of Rally Data Junkie's (https://rallydatajunkie.com/) work on the Dakar 2025 API updated for 2026 with a Python and Flask based visualiser. I use it for projecting to a screen to see how things are going on each stage in realtime. 

Disclaimer: Put together over two nights in 2026, probably lots of mistakes and wrong calculations. Feel free to propose changes. I'm thinking for 2027 to do something far more comprehensive if there is the demand for it.
